# bower-update-all
## Make ALL the updates!

Inspired by [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates).

### Usage

No bullshit :)

```
sudo npm install -g bower-update-all
```

```
bower-update-all
```
(in a folder with a bower.json file)

After this, dependencies in your file will be to their latest possible version.
